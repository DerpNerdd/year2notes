TypeScript: Super javascript

JS is a Subset of TypeScript
All JS is TS but not all TS is JS 

Benefits:
    - Static Typing
    - Code Completion 
    - Refactoring
    - Shorthand notations

Type of Languages

Statically-Typed
(C++, C#, Java)
    int number = 10
    number = "a"** Error immediately before having to compile to find out

Dynamically-Typed
(Javascript, Python, Ruby)
    let number = 10
    number = "a"

    Math.round(number) **Would pass the emit code check but error when it runs which sucks

TypeScript: Just JS with Type Casting AKA OOP Principles and much more

Pros:
    - Insane Scalability
    - Ability to use featureas JS can't in JS applications
    - Allows for better maintenance/changes for the lifetime of the application 

Cons:
    - Always have to compile (transpilation)
    - Stricter Coding Style 
    - Technically more typing 

Why you should use TypeScript:
    - Research has shown that TypeScript can spot 15% of common bugs
    - Readability- It is easier to see what the code is supposed to do. And when working in a team, it is easier to see what the other developers intended
    - It's popular - knowing TypeScript will enable you to apply to more good jobs
    - Learning TypeScript will give you a better understanding, and a new perspective, on Javascript
    - Addresses the shortcomings of Javascript

Why you shouldn't use TypeScript:
    - TypeScript takes longer to write than JavaScript, as you have to specify types, so for smaller solo projects it might not be worth using it
    - TypeScript has to be compiled - which can take time, especially in larger projects 

    BUTTT.... 

    But the extra time that you have to spend writing more precise code and compiling will be more than saved by how many fewer bugs you'll have in your code
    
    For many projects - especially medium to large projects - TypeScript will save you lots of time and headaches

    And if you already know JavaScript, TypeScript will not be hard to learn

4 Ways to Compile:
Use the following commands in the terminal
1. For specific file
    - tsc [name of file] Ex. tsc index
2. For all files in the terminal folder (BEST OPTION)
    - tsc 
3. If you want a specific name 
    - tsc index.js --outline file-name.js
4. Have the file watched like SASS
    - tsc index.ts -w
