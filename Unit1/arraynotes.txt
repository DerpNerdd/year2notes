Why start with ARRAYS
This is because they are required and pivotal in every website, database, web applications...etc
For our immediate use Arrays are required to easily pupulate websites

Ternaries
This is just a quick reminder about how ternaries work, think of them as small if statements
{conditional ? truePath : falsePath}

The spread Operator
The spread operator (...) will iterate through and add all values from an array-like object
Book Version 2 will have all the same values but we changed pages to 140 and added an author property
