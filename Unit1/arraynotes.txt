Why start with ARRAYS
This is because they are required and pivotal in every website, database, web applications...etc.
For our immediate use Arrays are required to easily populate websites

Ternaries
This is just a quick reminder about how ternaries work, think of them as small if statements
{conditional ? truePath : falsePath}

The spread Operator
The spread operator â€¦ will iterate through and add all values from an array-like object
Book Version 2 will have all the same values but we changed pages to 140 and added an author property

Mapping Arrays
When you have an array with several items that you want to break down the best way is .map()
.map() is an array method that will go through each of the items and do a thing
The nice part of .map() is that it returns a whole new array when it's finished
Other method such as forEach() do not create new arrays and instead just paste content for the existing array


Anatomy of .map()

let newArray = people.map((person) => {})
The first part of a map method is a variable name that will represent each item from your array
This variable name should be named as the singular or the array
    people => person
    books => book

let newArray = people.map((person) => {
    const {name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
})
Next you can de-structure your item if you like, this is not required but does make the setup easier

let newArray = people.map((person) => {
    const {name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
    return {...person, shirtColor: 'tie-dye', isNice: 'yes'};
})
Lastly you need to return the object back from the map.

.forEach()
forEach doesn't return an array as an output.
You have 3 value that you can use to work with:
    value
    index
    array (the entire thing)
The last export of a forEach loop is 'undefined' this really messes with returning values
Instead you can have an conditional that acts depending on the values returned
    Counting occurrences
    Breaking up the array into smaller arrays
    Printing out every name that starts with A

.filter()
Filter is how you can remove certain items from your array
It will go through each item and compare them to a conditional that you set up, true gets added and false does not
