Introduction to Node.js 

What is NODEJS
    Node is an enviornment that allows us to run JS outside of the browser
    Built using chrome's V8 JS Engine
    Node has a large and great community that is adding to the libraries avaliable

Differences from Browser to Node  
    There is no DOM (Dom calls error out)
    There is no Window object to reference
    This runs server side apps 
    Great for filesystem (accessing the computer not just the browser)
    They use commonJS so we don't need to worry about ES6 or browser compatibility 

REPL & CLI
    REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) is a terminal command that lets us use Node
    CLI (Command Line Interface) is the better was that we can use Node

Starting REPL
To start up Node all you need to do is type 'node' into the terminal and you will see the terminal type change to node

REPL 101
Repl is kind of like having a small IDE in your terminal you can create variables and call them in the terminal but this is very inefficient and just for playing around
To exit REPL we hit 'ctrl + c'

CLI 
This is the version that runs js files and compiles them for the terminal
If you type in 'node filename.js' the file will be compiled and run without the need for a browser Engine

Globals
    Just like JS, there are several global variables that we are able to use anywhere
    For instance 'console' we dont need to define this, node already knows
    We call these globals

Here are a few globals that you should knows
    __dirname (with 2 __'s)
        Path to current directory
    --filename (with 2 __'s)
        The current file name
    require
        Allows us to use Modules
    module
        Info about the current module
    process
        info about the env where the program is being executed

Modules
    Modules are Node's way of saying files, EVERY >JS FILE IS A MODULE
    We can use these in ES6 but we use the import command
    Node uses 'require' instead of import  


Built-In Modules
There are a lot of built in modules that are useful for different programs
We are going to be using 4 main ones but you can find more int he docs if you want to make your own projects
